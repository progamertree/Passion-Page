                <p>The trade caused serious controversy and damaged the Mavericks' reputation.  
                    The Mavericks may have been better off keeping Dončić, who was one of the NBA's best young superstars. Due to the timing of the trade, the Mavericks may not have enough time to form chemistry with Davis before the season ends. Davis was seen as a better cultural fit for the Mavericks but overall, many Mavericks fans are upset about the trade and feel that the team traded away one of their best players. </p>

                <h2>Luka Doncic on the Lakers</h2>

                <p>Lakers general manager Pelinka says that trading Luka was one of the best decisions for their whole franchise. Doncic is still young and has a high ceiling of becoming one of the best players to ever play in the Nba. "Luka is a one-of-a-kind, young global superstar who will lead this franchise for years to come," Pelinka said in a statement released by the team Sunday. "His killer instincts and commitment to winning championships will be a driving force for the team. We will be relentless in building a roster around the on-court vision Coach Redick has for this basketball team and there is an unwavering commitment to that work to serve our loyal and dedicated fans. We are grateful for today and look forward to what's next."</p>

                <h2>His future with the Lakers and Lebron's Legacy</h2>

                <p>Doncic is under contract for the 2025-26 season and has a player option for the 2026-27 season that he will almost assuredly opt out of if he doesn’t sign an extension prior. Regardless of his contract situation, though, Doncic appears set to carve out a new future in L.A. Luka Dončić could help LeBron James win a fifth NBA title, which would put James one championship behind Michael Jordan. Dončić's abilities could complement James's, and the two could lead the Lakers to an NBA title. Dončić carried the Dallas Mavericks to the NBA Finals last year, but he didn't win a championship with them. Having a superstar team such as the Lakers might give Doncic his first ever championship.</p>
